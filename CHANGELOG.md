## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **MCP Server**: `trend_research()` used `answer.text` instead of `answer.answer`, causing AttributeError
- **Pipeline**: `generate-all` workflow used wrong method names (`generate_slides`/`download_slides` → `generate_slide_deck`/`download_slide_deck`)
- **Tests**: `test_list_returns_json_array` called async `cmd_list` without await (coroutine never executed)
- **Tests**: replaced deprecated `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` with `inspect.iscoroutinefunction()`
